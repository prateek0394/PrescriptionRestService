*The principal motivation behind this project is to practice and evaluate engineering best practices on (what we think) is a complex idea.*
*There will be plenty of blatant over-engineering done for pedagodical purposes.*

**List of ideas to learn**

- Security - authorization, authentication for rest endpoints
- Policy - as json not Java
- Internationalization (i18n)
- JaxRS Rest Service
- Spring Boot
- Designing a rule engine
- Angular 2
